# 🎯 **Flutter Coding Challenge**

This project was created using **Flutter** version **3.24.3** as part of a coding challenge. The goal is to implement a responsive login screen that communicates with a REST backend (e.g., https://reqres.in) and works seamlessly across **iOS**, **Android**, and **Web** platforms. The app allows the user to log in and navigate through different screens while persisting user information. The state management solution chosen for this project is **[BloC](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc)** for its scalability and maintainability.

## 🚀 **Development server**

To run the application in development mode, use the following command:

```bash
flutter run
```

For web, ensure you're using:

```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

Navigate to the respective platform's emulator or web browser to see the application running. The app will automatically reload when you modify the source files.

## 🛠️ **Code scaffolding**

You can generate new components, classes, or other elements using the following command:

```bash
flutter create component_name
```

## 🏗️ **Build**

To build the project for production, use the following command for **Android**:

```bash
flutter build apk
```

For **Web**, use:

```bash
flutter build web
```

Build artifacts will be stored in the `build/` directory.

## 🧪 **Running tests**

To run unit tests for the project:

```bash
flutter test
```

## 🔄 **State Management**

This project uses the **[BloC (Business Logic Component)](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc)** pattern for state management to ensure scalability, maintainability, and a clear separation of concerns.
